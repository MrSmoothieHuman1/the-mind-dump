-- factorio mod idea: really hone in on the alien aspect of Nauvis

idea:
  - use fish for ores, skin certain type of fish for their scales, melt the scales down into slag, then melt slag for iron ore. (can also use dead fish for fuel)
  - probably incoporate Alien Biomes into mod.
  - Use fish tanks to generate Ore Fish, early game
  - Use water pump-esque build for certain type of plants, rice-esque plants.
